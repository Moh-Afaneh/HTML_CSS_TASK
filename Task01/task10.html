          <h2><u>What is the introduction of math?</u></h2>
          <p>
            Mathematics is the
            <mark
              >science and study of quality, structure, space, and change.</mark
            >
            Mathematicians seek out patterns, formulate new conjectures, and
            establish truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen
            axioms and definitions.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is debate over whether mathematical objects such as numbers
            and points exist naturally or are human creations. The mathematician
            <strong>Benjamin Peirce</strong> called mathematics
            <strong>"the science that draws necessary conclusions"</strong>
            <mark>Albert Einstein</mark> , on the other hand, stated that "as
            far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not
            certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to
            reality."
          </p>
          <p>
            <u
              >Today, mathematics is used throughout the world as an essential
              tool in many fields, including natural science, engineering,
              medicine, and the social sciences.</u
            >
            Applied mathematics, the branch of mathematics concerned with
            application of mathematical knowledge to other fields, inspires and
            makes use of new mathematical discoveries and sometimes leads to the
            development of entirely new disciplines. Mathematicians also engage
            in pure mathematics, or mathematics for its own sake, without having
            any application in mind, although practical applications for what
            began as pure mathematics are often discovered later.

            different forms of matter combine with each other. You study
